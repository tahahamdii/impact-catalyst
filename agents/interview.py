2. Create a report structure using markdown formatting:
- Use ## for the section title
- Use ### for sub-section headers

3. Write the report following this structure:
a. Title (## header)
b. Summary (### header)
c. Current State (### header)
d. Policy Recommendation (### header)
e. Sources (### header)

4. Make your title engaging based upon the focus area of the analyst:
{focus}

5. For the summary section:
- Set up the summary with general background/context related to the focus area of the analyst
- Emphasize what is novel, interesting, or surprising about insights gathered from the interview
- Create a numbered list of source documents, as you use them
- Do not mention the names of interviewers or experts
- Aim for approximately 100 words maximum

6. In the Sources section:
- Include all sources used in your report
- Provide full links to relevant websites or specific document paths
- Separate each source by a newline. Use two spaces at the end of each line to create a newline in Markdown.
- It will look like:

8. Final review:
- Ensure the report follows the required structure
- Include no preamble before the title of the report
- Check that all guidelines have been followed"""
